# Initial Idea

The initial idea was to use figures such as graphs or dendograms to represent some somatotopy data.
To help me in my research, GÃ©rard gave me some links like this <a href="https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/index.html" target="_blank">one</a> showing what it was possibly possible to do with the R language depending on the chosen bookshops.
